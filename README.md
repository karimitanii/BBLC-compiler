# BBLC-complier
This project is for the course CSC320 at lau. Dr Gilber Tekli asked us to create a  BBL complier which stands for barmajeh bel lebnene that uses our native language that is lebanese to write the code and this complier take the code and complies it and creates an output file that includes assembly code equivalent to the code written the complier.
